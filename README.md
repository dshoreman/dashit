# DASHit

## Introduction (wtf is DASHit?)

*DASHit* is a set of Bash scripts that automate and/or simplify the majority of the Arch Linux installation process.  
It's short for *Dave's Arch System Helper/install tool*. If you read it any other way, that's on you.

Tl;dr: It builds on scripts previously in [my dotfiles] to automate everything from format to first boot, because frankly I'll never
remember every single step in [the Installation Guide], and I'm too lazy to format disks manually for each new install.
